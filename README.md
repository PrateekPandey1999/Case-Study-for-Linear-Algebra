In this instructional work , my aim is to develop into the application of explicit finite volume methods for solving one-dimensional pure diffusion scenarios in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) using MATLAB. In explicit methods, variables are alliteratively solved for each spatial location, while implicit methods solve for all points simultaneously by formulating and solving a set of equations.
The problem at hand involves a steady one-dimensional convection-conduction case, examining the diffusion of temperature in a rod with specified boundary conditions. The rod has a length of 0.5 meters, with the left boundary at 100 and the right boundary at 500 Kelvin. The thermal conductivity is 1000 W/m·K, and the cross-sectional area is 10e-3 m². The governing equation follows Fourier's law of heat diffusion.
For the finite volume discretization process, dividing the rod into finite volumes and introducing node points are done. Interior and boundary nodes are distinguished, emphasizing the importance of meshing systems commonly used in CFD solvers. The governing equation is integrated over each finite volume, leading to a simplified form using Gauss divergence theorem.
For interior nodes, the discretization involves a central differencing scheme, resulting in a standard form of finite volume equations. The boundary nodes require special treatment, introducing forward and backward differencing for gradient estimation. The resulting equations are organized into a matrix form, and the overall approach is illustrated for both left and right boundaries.
